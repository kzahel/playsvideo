**You probably don't need VLC.** Play any video file in the browser — no install, no upload.

[Try it at playsvideo.com](https://playsvideo.com) &nbsp;|&nbsp; Drop a file. It plays.

---

Many video files won't play in a browser — not because the browser can't *decode* the video, but because it can't open the container or handle the audio codec. playsvideo fixes that entirely client-side: it remuxes containers and transcodes audio on the fly, so your MKV with AC-3 audio just works.

### What it handles

| | Formats | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Containers** | MKV, MP4, AVI, TS, WebM | Demuxed and remuxed to fMP4 |
| **Video** | H.264, H.265 (HEVC), VP9, AV1 | Passthrough — plays ~99% of files (~90% on Firefox; HEVC transcode planned) |
| **Audio** | AAC, MP3, AC-3, E-AC-3, DTS, FLAC, Opus | Unsupported or pipeline-unsafe codecs transcoded to AAC on the fly |
| **Subtitles** | SRT, ASS/SSA | Extracted and displayed as WebVTT |

See [supported media](docs/supported-media.md) for the full codec matrix, browser compatibility, and transcode details.

### How it works

```
Video file (MKV, MP4, AVI, …)
  → mediabunny demux (streaming, any file size)
  → keyframe-aligned segment plan
  → per segment:
      video remuxed / passed through
      audio transcoded only if needed (AC-3/E-AC-3/DTS/MP3/FLAC/Opus → AAC)
      muxed to fMP4
  → hls.js plays segments on demand
  → subtitles extracted to WebVTT
```

Note: during Safari testing, direct AC-3 playback in the remux/HLS pipeline produced audible stalls around scene cuts and GOP transitions. The pipeline now treats AC-3/E-AC-3 as unsafe for MSE playback and transcodes them to AAC instead of relying on native AC-3 support.

Video transcode is almost never needed — browsers natively decode the vast majority of video codecs. When audio transcode is needed, a lightweight 1.8 MB ffmpeg.wasm build is lazy-loaded entirely in-browser. No SharedArrayBuffer required — works on any host without special CORS headers.

### Under the hood

The obvious approach — ffmpeg compiled to WebAssembly — can't handle large files (WORKERFS is catastrophically slow, MEMFS can't hold them). The trick is to split the problem:

- **[mediabunny](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny)** — streaming demux/remux in pure TypeScript, works on any size file
- **[ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/ffmpeg.wasm)** — only transcodes short audio segments via MEMFS
- **[hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js)** — battle-tested HLS playback via Media Source Extensions

Each piece existed separately. Nobody combined them.

### Use as a library

```bash
npm install playsvideo
```

```ts
import { PlaysVideoEngine } from 'playsvideo';

const video = document.querySelector('video')!;
const engine = new PlaysVideoEngine(video);

// Play a local file (drag-and-drop, <input type="file">, etc.)
engine.loadFile(file);

// Or play from a URL (requires CORS + range request support)
engine.loadUrl('https://example.com/video.mkv');

// Or attach an external .srt/.vtt subtitle file after loading
await engine.loadExternalSubtitle(subtitleFile);

engine.destroy(); // clean up
```

See [engine API docs](docs/engine-api.md) for events, properties, and full usage.

### Roadmap

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the full list. Highlights:

- **User-imported subtitles** — load external `.srt`/`.vtt` files alongside the video
- **WebCodecs** — replace ffmpeg.wasm with hardware-accelerated `AudioDecoder`/`AudioEncoder` and `VideoDecoder`/`VideoEncoder`
